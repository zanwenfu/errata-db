# Session table columns

`data/<source>/*.parquet`: one row per session (per file for Aider and SpecStory), one folder per source, all with the same 36 columns. A session found in several places has a row for each; `duplicate_of` marks the copies set aside, which have no files and no rows in the conversation tables. `session_key` links a session to its rows there.

"Empty" means null. Types are Parquet's: `string`, `text` (a string that can be long), `int`, `bool` and `timestamp` (UTC), and lists or records where shown.

| Column | Type | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_key` | string | `<source>:<source_id>`, unique across the dataset. | Links to the conversation tables. |
| `source` | string | The source. |  |
| `source_id` | string | The session's id within its source, such as a repository and file path, or a dataset record. |  |
| `session_id` | string | The agent's own session id. | Empty for Aider and OpenHands feedback, and for about half of SpecStory's sessions. |
| `checkpoint_pk` | string | Entire's `<repository>#<checkpoint id>`. | Entire and SWE-chat v2 only. |
| `strategy` | string | How Entire saved the session. | Entire and SWE-chat v2 only. |
| `dedup_key` | string | The key duplicates are matched on: `<agent>:<session id>` where recorded, else `sha256:<digest of the files>`. |  |
| `found_url` | string | Where the session was found: a GitHub commit or file, or a dataset. |  |
| `found_commit` | string | The commit the files were read from: a repository's commit, or a copied dataset's revision. | Empty for about a quarter of Entire's sessions. |
| `fetched_at` | string | When the files were fetched (ISO 8601, UTC). | Empty for copied datasets. |
| `collector_version` | string | The version of the software that fetched them. | Empty for copied datasets. |
| `content_sha256` | string | A digest of the files as fetched, before masking. | Empty for copied datasets. |
| `repo` | string | The GitHub repository, as `owner/name`. | Empty for DataClaw and OpenHands. |
| `repo_url` | string | The repository's URL. |  |
| `repo_license` | string | GitHub's reading of the repository's licence: an SPDX id, `none` (no licence file) or `unrecognized`. | Empty where the repository could not be looked up. |
| `repo_language` | string | GitHub's main language of the repository. |  |
| `agent` | string | The coding agent. | Empty where the files do not name it. |
| `agent_version` | string | The agent's version. | Not recorded for DataClaw, OpenHands feedback or SpecStory. |
| `models` | list of strings | The models the session used. |  |
| `started_at` | string | The first message's time (ISO 8601, UTC). | Empty where the files record no time with a time zone (every Aider session); a time without one is kept in `source_facts`. |
| `ended_at` | string | The last message's time (ISO 8601, UTC). | Empty where the files record no time with a time zone (every Aider session); a time without one is kept in `source_facts`. |
| `file_format` | string | `jsonl`, `json`, `markdown` or `parquet`. |  |
| `n_user_entries` | int | Every entry in the user's role, typed or not. | For Claude Code this includes tool outputs. |
| `n_user_messages` | int | Messages the developer typed, each counted once. | Empty where who typed cannot be told (Codex sessions with no typed-message mark, scripted runs such as `codex exec`). |
| `n_agent_messages` | int | The agent's messages with text. | For Claude Code, distinct API messages, its `<synthetic>` replies left out. |
| `n_tool_calls` | int | The agent's tool calls. | 0 for Aider, whose edits are not tool calls. |
| `has_tool_results` | bool | Whether the files record what tools returned. | Empty where the session's files were not read. |
| `has_timestamps` | bool | Whether the files record times. |  |
| `n_conversation_rows` | int | The session's rows in `conversations`. | Empty for a duplicate, and where the session's files were not read (no reader for its agent, or no file); 0 where they were read and gave no rows. `source_facts` (`conversations_error`) says why. |
| `n_subagent_rows` | int | The session's rows in `conversations_subagents`. |  |
| `bytes` | int | The total size of the session's files. |  |
| `duplicate_of` | string | For a duplicate, the `session_key` of the copy that was kept. | A duplicate has no files and no rows. |
| `also_in` | list of `{source, source_id, found_url}` | Every other place the session was found. |  |
| `redactions` | `{secrets, emails, home_users}` | How many secrets, emails and home-folder names were masked in its files. |  |
| `source_facts` | text (JSON) | Details only some sources have, such as Entire's checkpoint ids and CLI version, a copied dataset's name, revision and licence, and `typed_fingerprint`, a digest of the typed messages in order. | Keys differ by source. |
| `files` | list of `{path, bytes, sha256, content}` | The session's raw files, masked. |  |
